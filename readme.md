# CanJS demo

This demo is derived from an exercise to reproduce the code on http://cancommand.herokuapp.com/. This code was written when I was in a [Bitovi training](http://bitovi.com/training) led by [Alexis Abril](https://github.com/alexisabril).

The basic concepts are to utilize [can.Models](http://canjs.com/docs/can.Model.html), [can.Component](http://canjs.com/docs/can.Component.html), [can.stache](http://canjs.com/docs/can.stache.html) (for live binding with improved [`mustache`](https://mustache.github.io/) templates) and [stealJS](http://stealjs.com/) for dependency management.

I wrote this code as an exercise during the training (thanks [@WalmartLabs](https://twitter.com/walmartlabs)), but I will be modifying it periodically to trying things out (and I'm about to fork it and try the [`ES6`](https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader/wiki/Brief-Overview-of-ES6-Module-syntax) syntax.  Yum.)
